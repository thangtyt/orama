                This is a sample application for the <a href="http://arrowjs.io">ArrowJs Framework</a>.
                We expect to implement as many features as possible to show how the framework works and its potential.
                Please write us if you have any feedback or comments. Feel free to clone the code of this application
                <a href="https://github.com/seko91/album-o-rama-arrowjs">here</a>.
                The purpose of this application is merely academic. Thanks!.
